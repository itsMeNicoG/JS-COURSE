# JS COURSE

This repository consist on a series of exercises and tests that I've been working on as part of a JavaScript course. This mainly includes basic exercises. 

## Usage

```git
git clone https://github.com/itsMeNicoG/JS-COURSE
```
Make sure you edit the index.html or exercises.html and link it to the corresponding JS file as I decided to keep just these two HTML files.
